        loves it and actually keeps it on for a little while! The material is nice

      <p><span class="reviewer">Harvy:</span>
      <span class="review"> I bought the dog toy for my dog and the cat yarn toy
      for my cat. My dog has been chewing on the toy for a while now and it's
    holding up okay so far! If you have a pup who likes to chew this will work for you.
  My cat seems indifferent to the toy most days but I think that's her personality,
not the product.</span></p>
