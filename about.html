<h2>About us:</h2>
<p>Furry Baby was founded in 2010 by local, Jane Doe. Jane believed in helping
keep her pets fashioanle and healthy. Many people wanted Jane's advice on where
she gets all of her items and products from and were surprised to find out that
she did it herself! So Jane got to work with a team of equally passionate locals
on starting the Furry Baby shop. Together we work hard to bring your best Furry
Friends their best life. We assure all our products are the best quality so that
you can rest easy knowing that your pets are in good hands.</p>
